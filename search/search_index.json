This pivot is intended to make learning more engaging by introducing a game-like element to the application. Challenge Mode will challenge users to apply qubit gate pulses that move the system from the |0\u27e9 state to target states on the Bloch sphere, incorporating real-world considerations like T1 errors and dephasing time, which add complexity and realism to the simulations.  Future additions will incorporate engineering microwave pulses, rather than gates, for additional complexity and realism. </p>"},{"location":"draft/#core-application-overview","title":"Core Application Overview","text":"<p>At its core, Qublitz serves as a sophisticated Bloch sphere animation tool.
